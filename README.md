# No-Show Medical Appointments-Brasil,2016-Analysis Report
## Overview:
This project was completed as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree certification. The goal of this project is to investigate a dataset that includes more than 100k records of scheduled medical appointments in Brazil in 2016. To have the ability to answer the following questions:
<ul> 
    <li>What is the dataset age distribution and attendance distribution?</li>
    <li>What is the effect of having a scholarship on the attendance rate?</li>
    <li>Is there any coloration between the gender and the attendance?</li>
    <li>What is the distribution of scholarships between the two gender?</li>
    <li>Does sending a confirmation SMS could increase the attendance rate?</li>
</ul>

## Findings:
<ul><li>Scheduling visits started on 2015-11-10 and ended on 2016-06-08.</li>
    <li>Visit appointments started on 2016-04-29 and ended on 2016-06-08.</li>
    <li>The average age of this dataset is 37 years.</li>
    <li>Some of these patients are babies less than a year.</li>
    <li>The maximum age of this data is 99 years.</li>
    <li>The average gap = 9.2 days.</li>
	  <li>The maximum gap = 178 days which seems a little weird that some one schedule and appointment after more than 5 months.</li>
    <li>The shorten awaiting period the more patients show up. Patiens scheduling appointments for the same day are much more likely to show up. </li>
    <li>Less than 10% of the patients recorded in this dataset have a scholarship.</li>
    <li>Almost there is a very slight difference between the percentage of attendance in patients that have a scholarship and those that havenâ€™t.</li>
    <li>Males represent 35% of the records and around 28% of them have attended their appointments.</li> 
    <li>Females represents 65% of the records and around 51% of them have attended their appointments.</li>
    <li>Females are more likely to attend their appointments. </li>
    <li>Only 5.1% of Males have a scholarship while Females have 12.3%.</li>
    <li>There is almost no difference between the rate of attendance between patients who received a SMS and those who did not.</li>
</ul>
